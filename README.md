# `tb6612fng`

> Crate to interface the TB6612FNG, a dual H bridge motor driver

There are lots of motor driver ICs out there. Their functionality (modulo power rating) is about the
same but some expose different interfaces. Eventually, this crate will turn into a more general
`h_bridge` crate that provides interfaces to the most common motor driver ICs.
